# Compatibility Guide

## Physics Systems

### Will this work with NVIDIA PhysX?

**No. This add-on is NOT compatible with NVIDIA PhysX, and PhysX is not used in Fallout 4 modding.**

### Understanding Physics Systems

There are two major physics engines in game development:

1. **NVIDIA PhysX** (by NVIDIA)
   - Used in: Unreal Engine games, some Unity games, various other titles
   - Repositories: NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX
   - **NOT used in Bethesda games**

2. **Havok Physics** (by Havok/Microsoft)
   - Used in: Bethesda Creation Engine games (Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Starfield)
   - Commercial physics engine
   - **This is what Fallout 4 uses**

### Fallout 4's Physics System

Fallout 4 exclusively uses **Havok Physics**:
- All collision detection uses Havok
- All dynamic physics uses Havok
- All animations with physics use Havok
- PhysX is not present in the game engine

### What This Add-on Does

This Blender add-on is specifically designed for **Fallout 4 modding**:

✅ **Creates meshes compatible with Fallout 4's Havok system**
- Exports to FBX format (convertible to .nif with Havok collision data)
- Generates basic collision meshes (simplified geometry)
- Optimizes meshes for Fallout 4's engine limits

❌ **Does NOT support NVIDIA PhysX**
- PhysX is incompatible with Fallout 4
- PhysX libraries are not used
- PhysX simulations cannot be exported to Fallout 4

❌ **Does NOT provide full Havok simulation**
- Advanced physics require Havok Content Tools (separate software)
- This add-on creates the geometry; Havok tools create the physics

## Blender Compatibility

### Supported Blender Versions
- ✅ Blender 3.0+
- ✅ Blender 3.6 (tested)
- ✅ Blender 4.0+ (should work)
- ❌ Blender 2.x (not supported)

### Supported Platforms
- ✅ Windows 10/11
- ✅ macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- ✅ Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.)

### Python Requirements
- ✅ Python 3.10+ (bundled with Blender)
- Optional: PIL/Pillow (for Image to Mesh feature)
- Optional: NumPy (for Image to Mesh feature)
- Optional: PyTorch (for AI features)

## Game Compatibility

### Fallout 4
✅ **Full Support** - This add-on is designed specifically for Fallout 4
- Mesh optimization for FO4 limits (65,535 polygons)
- Material setup compatible with FO4 shaders
- Collision mesh generation for Havok physics
- Export to FBX (convertible to .nif)

### Other Games

❌ **Not designed for:**
- Fallout 3 (uses GameBryo, different limits)
- Fallout: New Vegas (uses GameBryo, different limits)
- Skyrim (similar but different workflow)
- Starfield (Creation Engine 2, different workflow)
- Games using PhysX (Unreal, Unity, etc.)

⚠️ **May work with modifications:**
- The tools are generic enough that they could help with other Bethesda games
- However, limits, material setups, and workflows differ
- Not officially supported for non-FO4 games

## External Tool Compatibility

### Required for Full Fallout 4 Workflow

This add-on works **with** these tools (not a replacement):

1. **NifSkope** - View/edit .nif files
   - ✅ Compatible - Export FBX, convert to NIF, edit in NifSkope
   - Required for final .nif adjustments

2. **Creation Kit** - Bethesda's official modding tool
   - ✅ Compatible - Use this add-on to create assets, then import in CK
   - Required for in-game integration

3. **Outfit Studio** - Body/armor editing
   - ✅ Compatible - Meshes from this add-on can be used
   - Optional, for body/armor mods

4. **Havok Content Tools** - Physics simulation
   - ✅ Compatible - Create meshes here, add physics in Havok tools
   - Required for complex physics (ragdolls, cloth, etc.)

5. **Mod Organizer 2** / **Vortex** - Mod managers
   - ✅ Compatible - Exported mods work with all mod managers

### Optional Dependencies

**For Image to Mesh feature:**
- PIL/Pillow (Python library)
- NumPy (Python library)

**For AI features (optional):**
- PyTorch
- Tencent Hunyuan3D-2 (NOT NVIDIA PhysX)
- Gradio (for web interface)

**For Motion features (optional):**
- git-lfs
- Tencent HY-Motion-1.0

## Common Compatibility Questions

### Q: Can I clone NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX to use with this add-on?
**A:** No. PhysX is not compatible with Fallout 4. Fallout 4 uses Havok physics, which is a completely different system. Cloning the PhysX repository will not help with Fallout 4 modding.

### Q: Does Blender's physics system work with this add-on?
**A:** Blender's built-in physics (rigid body, cloth, fluid) is for preview/animation only. It does not export to Fallout 4. For in-game physics, you need Havok Content Tools after creating your mesh in Blender.

### Q: Can I convert PhysX files to Havok?
**A:** No. PhysX and Havok use completely different file formats and are not interchangeable. They are proprietary, competing physics engines.

### Q: Will this work with Unreal Engine / Unity?
**A:** No. This add-on is specifically designed for Fallout 4 (Creation Engine with Havok). For Unreal/Unity, use their native pipelines and PhysX support (if applicable).

### Q: Can I export to formats other than FBX?
**A:** Currently, FBX is the primary export format (for conversion to .nif). Direct .nif export may be added in the future with PyNifly integration.

## Technical Specifications

### Fallout 4 Limits (What This Add-on Enforces)
- Maximum polygons: 65,535 per mesh
- Maximum bones: 256 per skeleton
- Texture dimensions: Power-of-2 recommended (512, 1024, 2048, 4096)
- File format: .nif (exported as FBX, then converted)

### Physics System
- Engine: Havok Physics

- Simulation: Havok Content Tools (for advanced features)

### Not Supported
- PhysX physics
- Direct .nif export (requires external conversion)
- Real-time in-Blender preview of Havok physics
- Automatic physics property setup
