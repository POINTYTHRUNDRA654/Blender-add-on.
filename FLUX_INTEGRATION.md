## Using FLUX.1 for FO4 Textures

### Workflow 1: Generate Tileable Textures

**Prompts for FO4 Textures:**

```
Metal Textures:
- "rusty corrugated metal texture, post-apocalyptic, weathered, seamless tile"
- "scratched steel plate texture, industrial, worn, seamless"
- "oxidized copper texture, green patina, aged, tileable"

Concrete/Stone:
- "damaged concrete wall texture, bullet holes, cracks, seamless tile"
- "weathered brick texture, post-apocalyptic, broken, tileable"
- "rubble texture, broken concrete, debris, seamless pattern"

Wood:
- "old wooden planks texture, rotted, weathered, seamless tile"
- "splintered wood texture, damaged, abandoned building, tileable"

Vault-Tec:
- "vault-tec wall panel texture, blue and yellow, sci-fi metal, worn, seamless"
- "retro-futuristic metal panel texture, art deco, 1950s aesthetic, tileable"
```

**ComfyUI Setup:**
1. Load FLUX.1-dev model
2. Set prompt (examples above)
3. Resolution: 1024x1024 (for seamless tiling)
4. Steps: 20-30
5. CFG Scale: 3.5-7.0
6. Enable tiling options if available

### Workflow 2: Concept Art Generation

**Prompts for FO4 Assets:**

```
Weapons:
- "fallout 4 style laser rifle, side view, white background, game asset"
- "post-apocalyptic makeshift rifle, rust and metal, technical drawing style"
- "sci-fi plasma weapon, retro-futuristic design, concept art"

Armor:
- "power armor helmet, fallout style, front view, white background"
- "raider armor pieces, makeshift metal plates, leather straps"

Props:
- "rusty barrel with nuclear warning symbol, fallout 4 style"
- "vintage computer terminal, retro-futuristic, 1950s aesthetic"
- "nuka cola vending machine, red and white, weathered, post-apocalyptic"
```

### Workflow 3: Reference Images

Generate reference images for manual modeling:

```
- "post-apocalyptic building facade, multiple angles"
- "ruined interior room, debris, dramatic lighting"
- "wasteland landscape with destroyed buildings, concept art"
```

## ComfyUI Workflows for FLUX.1

### Basic Texture Generation Workflow

**Nodes:**
1. **FLUX Loader** → Load flux1-dev.safetensors
2. **CLIP Text Encoder** → Input your prompt
3. **Empty Latent Image** → Set size (1024x1024)
4. **KSampler** → Generate image
5. **VAE Decode** → Convert to image
6. **Save Image** → Export result

### Advanced Workflow with ControlNet

For matching existing geometry:

1. **Load FLUX.1 model**
2. **Load ControlNet model** (depth, normal, etc.)
3. **Input control image** (UV layout, depth map)
4. **CLIP Text Encoder** (texture description)
5. **KSampler with ControlNet**
6. **VAE Decode**
7. **Save Image**

### Batch Generation Workflow

Generate multiple texture variations:

1. **FLUX Loader**
2. **CLIP Text Encoder** with prompt variations
3. **Batch processing node**
4. **Loop through different seeds**
5. **Save all outputs**

## GGUF Quantization for Lower VRAM

If you have limited VRAM (8-10GB), use GGUF quantized models:

### Available Quantizations

| Version | Size | VRAM | Quality |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| FP16 | ~24GB | 12GB+ | Perfect |
| Q8_0 | ~12GB | 8-10GB | Excellent |
| Q5_K | ~8GB | 6-8GB | Very Good |
| Q4_K | ~6GB | 4-6GB | Good |

### Download GGUF Models

```bash
# Search for FLUX.1-dev GGUF on Hugging Face
# Example (check for latest versions):
git clone https://huggingface.co/city96/FLUX.1-dev-gguf

# Place in ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/
```

### Using GGUF in ComfyUI

1. Install ComfyUI-GGUF extension (see installation section)
2. Load GGUF file instead of full model
3. Use same workflow as regular FLUX.1
4. Slightly slower generation but uses less VRAM

## Optimizations for Performance

### For 8GB VRAM

**ComfyUI Launch Options:**
```bash
python main.py --lowvram
```

**In Workflow:**
- Use Q5_K or Q4_K GGUF models
- Generate at 512x512, upscale later
- Fewer sampling steps (15-20)
- Close other applications

### For 12GB VRAM

**Standard settings work well:**
- Use full FP16 model or Q8_0 GGUF
- Generate at 1024x1024
- 20-30 sampling steps
- Can batch 2-3 images

### For 24GB+ VRAM

**Maximum quality:**
- Full FP16 model
- Generate at 2048x2048
- 30-50 sampling steps
- Batch 4+ images
- Use ControlNet simultaneously

## Integration with Blender Add-on

### Complete Workflow: Texture Pipeline

**1. Generate Base Texture in ComfyUI:**
```
Prompt: "rusty metal wall texture, post-apocalyptic, weathered, seamless tile, 4k"
Resolution: 2048x2048
Save: weapon_diffuse.png
```

**2. In Blender with FO4 Add-on:**
```python
import bpy

# Select mesh
obj = bpy.context.active_object

# Use smart material setup
bpy.ops.fo4.smart_material_setup()
# Browse to weapon_diffuse.png

# Optimize for FO4
bpy.ops.fo4.optimize_mesh()
bpy.ops.fo4.validate_mesh()

# Export
bpy.ops.fo4.export_mesh()
```

### Workflow: Concept to 3D

**1. Generate concept in ComfyUI:**
```
Prompt: "fallout 4 laser rifle, side view orthographic, white background, technical drawing"
Save: laser_rifle_concept.png
```

**2. Convert to 3D in Blender:**
```python
# Use Shap-E image-to-3D
bpy.context.scene.fo4_shap_e_image_path = "laser_rifle_concept.png"
bpy.ops.fo4.generate_shap_e_image()
```

**3. Generate detailed texture:**
```
# Export UV layout from Blender
# Use as ControlNet input in ComfyUI
Prompt: "laser rifle texture, glowing blue energy cells, metal and plastic, worn"
```

**4. Apply and export:**
```python
bpy.ops.fo4.smart_material_setup()  # Apply generated texture
bpy.ops.fo4.export_mesh()
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering for FO4

**Structure:**
```
[Subject] [Material/Surface] texture, [style/era], [condition], [properties], [quality]
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good: "corrugated metal texture, post-apocalyptic, heavily rusted, bullet damage, seamless tile, 4k, high detail"

✅ Good: "vault-tec wall panel texture, retro-futuristic, blue and yellow color scheme, worn edges, art deco pattern, tileable"

❌ Avoid: "texture" (too vague)
❌ Avoid: "make it cool" (subjective)
```

**Negative Prompts:**
```
Common negatives: "blurry, low quality, watermark, text, signature, distorted, ugly, pixelated, jpeg artifacts"

For textures: "seamless, pattern break, visible seam, repetition obvious"
```

### Resolution Guidelines

**For FO4 Textures:**
- Small props: 512x512 → 1024x1024
- Weapons/armor: 1024x1024 → 2048x2048
- Large objects: 2048x2048 → 4096x4096
- Environments: 2048x2048+

Generate at target resolution or slightly higher, then optimize.

### Quality Settings

**Ultra-fast iteration (FLUX.1-schnell):**
- Steps: 4-8
- CFG: N/A (guidance-free)
- Resolution: 512x512 or 1024x1024
- Time: ~3-8 seconds
- Use for: Quick testing, concept exploration

**Fast iteration (FLUX.1-dev):**
- Steps: 15-20
- CFG: 3.5
- Resolution: 512x512
- Time: ~10-20 seconds
- Use for: Testing ideas

**Production quality (FLUX.1-dev):**
- Steps: 25-35
- CFG: 5.0-7.0
- Resolution: 1024x1024+
- Time: ~30-60 seconds
- Use for: Final assets

### Consistency Tips

For related textures (same object set):
- Use same seed across generations
- Keep prompt structure similar
- Use style keywords consistently
- Generate all variations in one session

## Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory Errors

**Solutions:**
1. Use GGUF quantized model (Q5_K or Q4_K)
2. Launch with `--lowvram` flag
3. Reduce resolution (512x512)
4. Fewer sampling steps
5. Close other GPU applications
6. Generate one image at a time

### Slow Generation

**Optimizations:**
1. Update GPU drivers
2. Use GGUF Q5_K (faster than FP16)
3. Enable xformers: `--xformers`
4. Reduce steps to 20-25
5. Generate at lower resolution, upscale later

### Poor Quality Results

**Improvements:**
1. Use full FP16 or Q8_0 model (not Q4_K)
2. Increase steps to 30-40
3. Adjust CFG scale (try 5-7)
4. Improve prompt detail
5. Use negative prompts
6. Try different seeds

### FLUX.1 Model Not Loading

**Checks:**
1. Verify model file is complete (~24GB)
2. Check file is in correct directory
3. Restart ComfyUI
4. Check console for errors
5. Verify sufficient disk space
