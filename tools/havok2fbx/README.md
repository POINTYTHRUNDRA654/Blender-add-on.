# Havok2FBX tool integration

This add-on expects the Havok2FBX binaries to be placed here for convenience.

Source location on this machine:
- `D:\Blender Foundation\havok2fbx_release_0.1a\havok2fbx.exe`
- `D:\Blender Foundation\havok2fbx_release_0.1a\libfbxsdk.dll`
- `D:\Blender Foundation\havok2fbx_release_0.1a\LICENSE`
- `D:\Blender Foundation\havok2fbx_release_0.1a\readme.txt`

To stage them alongside the add-on:
1) Copy `havok2fbx.exe` and `libfbxsdk.dll` into this folder.
2) (Optional) copy the accompanying `LICENSE` and `readme.txt` for reference.

Notes:
- The add-on can also be pointed to the original folder without copying; keeping the binaries in one place avoids duplicates.
- If you commit the add-on, avoid committing proprietary binaries unless allowed by their license.
